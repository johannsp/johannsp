      <h2>
      John L. Spetz
      </h2>

      <p>
      I am a programmer and web designer living in Willoughby Hills, Ohio on
      the North Coast, who enjoys both computer and human languages.  I have a
      strong background in traditional, procedural computer programming, which
      provides me with a strong grounding foundation to understanding the
      rapidly shifting and evolving, objected-oriented technologies that are
      transforming the Internet-connected world of today.
      </p>

      <p>
      I graduated from Case Western Reserve University in May 1992 with a
      Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Computer Science and a background in Borland's
      Turbo Pascal and C/C++ languages.  I learned to program both in the
      Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and at the command line using
      traditional make files.  The ability to work outside the IDE proved
      invaluable for working with software with a very large source base which
      had outgrown the conventional IDE and was divided into many independent
      modules.  This code base required more flexible, stand-alone trouble
      shooting approaches and testing methods.  It was critical both to test
      modules in isolation and do proper integration testing to ensure the
      overall system would function as expected with new changes.
      </p>

      <p>
      For many years, I was the lead programmer maintaining insurance policy
      processing software used by small insurance companies to rate premiums,
      issue transactions, and accumulate statistical information for bureau
      reporting purposes.  Our insurer accounts relied long-term upon stable
      software systems that allowed for regular rate updates and rule changes
      with absolute backward compatibility across decades of data, while
      allowing for the seamless addition of new lines of business or new state
      offerings as requested.  Over the course of my work, I learned to read
      insurance bureau manuals from outfits like ISO with comprehension as a
      part of writing specifications and coding required functionality.  Also
      as a part of work, I took a number of AICPCU insurance courses through
      The Institute and received high marks.
      </p>

      <p>
      I am working my way through the Summer 2020 session of the Case Western
      Reserve University (CWRU) Coding Boot Camp to expand my command of the
      latest web technologies.  In addition to deeper immersion into the world
      of HTML with CSS and Javascript programming, our class gains real world
      experience on both the browser front end and the server back end.  I gain
      new web-enabled ways of using my existing SQL database background
      knowledge.
